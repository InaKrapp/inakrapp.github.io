summary: A workshop on writing scientific papers with R Markdown
abstract: 'Writing scientific papers is essential for any student, but papers are often written in Latex, which can be challenging to learn. This workshop shows how RMarkdown can simplify and significantly improve the workflow of creating a scientific paper. By adding programming code, you can conduct entirely reproducible analyses within your paper, and if you still need a Latex version of your document, RMarkdown can create it for you.'
